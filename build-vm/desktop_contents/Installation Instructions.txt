Issue trackers monitor the progress of software development “issues”, such as bug fixes and discussions about features. Typically, developers
subscribe to issues they are interested in through the tracker, and are informed of changes and new developments via automated email. In
practice, however, this approach does not scale well, as developers may receive large volumes of messages that they must sort through using
their mail client; over time, it becomes increasingly challenging for them to maintain awareness of the issues that are relevant to their
activities and tasks. To address this problem, DASH tool can be used, it presents personalized views of issues; developers indicate issues of
interest and DASH presents customized views of their progress and informs them of changes as they occur.
